	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p> Once upon a time, there was a girl who had always had great facility with both letters and numbers. In 2014, 
	she set off to college to study the human brain, but quickly found herself falling in love
	with more than just the brain--she wanted to understand the mind. Her academic career began to unfold, and slowly,
	she began to delve into the worlds of cognitive science, linguistics, English, music, and computer science. Some would say
	that loving too many subjects is a bad thing, but she just smiled, for she knew that each academic area
	was able to richly complement all the others. And so, she wrote, she coded, she sang, and she studied happily ever.
</p>
<br>
<p> That girl was me. Hi. I'm Kathryn Speckels. </p>
<br>
<p> 
	I am a driven student motivated by a desire for deep understanding. A current senior at Vanderbilt University, 
	my academic interests span both the sciences and the humanities; I strive to create connections between 
	seemingly disparate bodies of knowledge. My experiences have taken me from Chicago to Nashville to Pittsburgh, working 
	in the fields of analytics, law, and information sciences,
	and I am always looking forward to the next big challenge. In addition to my schoolwork, I am the President of Vanderbilt
	Spoken Word, Vanderbilt's only slam poetry club; a team leader with Vanderbilt Student Volunteers for Science, an 
	organization that teaches fun science lessons to middle school students in the Nashville area; and I sing in Vanderbilt
	Chorale, the school's top choir, where I also research and analyze scores and composers to write program notes for 
	our performances. I always give my all in everything that I do--I believe that, with enough effort, anything is possible.
