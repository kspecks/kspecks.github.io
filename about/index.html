	Kathryn Speckels, sometimes referred to as "K-Specks," is a senior at Vanderbilt University, majoring in Cognitive Studies and 
	English with a minor in Computer Science. Though she currently resides in Nashville, she hails from the lovely little Chicago 
	suburb known as Naperville, where she frequently returns to visit with friends and family and eat real pizza 
	(because let's face it: Chicago-style is the only <i>true</i> pizza out there). 
</p>

<p>When she wants to sound professional, she tells people that she is the President of Vanderbilt Spoken Word, a Team Leader with 
	Vanderbilt Student Volunteers for Science, and an active member of the Vanderbilt Chorale (stay tuned for our upcoming album, 
	<i>Music in the Listening Place</i>) and the McGill Project. She is also currently working on a research project involving 
	indoor wayfinding technology for emergency first responders with a team from University of Pittsburgh's i3 program.
</p>

<p>When she wants to sound artsy, she tells people that she enjoys herbal tea, the most eclectic mix of music possible, animals of 
	all sorts, the key of D-flat major, words that nobody else has ever heard of (you might call her a bit of a 
	"word hipster"), and dresses and skirts. She detests wearing pants. 
</p>

<p>When she wants to sound sort of normal, she tells people that she watches Netflix (she is especially an avid fan of <i>Supernatural</i>, 
	<i>Master of None</i>, and <i>Sherlock</i>), has not yet discovered the meaning of life, reads and writes compulsively, 
	and sits up at obscenely late hours of the night because she gets too caught up in her books and her personal projects.
</p>

<p>Words and sounds were her first love, and will likely continue to be so for quite some time. However, they have been joined by a love 
	of logic, and the resulting combination is a facility for creative problem-solving and the ability to clearly communicate even
	the most complex of ideas.
</p>

<p>She also likes talking about herself in third-person.</p>
