	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
	<p>I'm a rising senior at Vanderbilt University, pursuing a double-major in Cognitive Studies and English with a Computer Science minor.
At this point, I'm just messing around with basic pages, and it will take a while to get my fonts and colors all pretty, but I'm still
working on it.</p>
