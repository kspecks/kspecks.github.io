<p>When I'm not busy with schoolwork, I spend a considerable amount of time writing. Since my arrival at Vanderbilt, I have become
  heavily involved with the school's spoken word scene, and as a result, I have a fairly substantial poetry portfolio. If you want to
  read some of what I've written, you can find some pieces <a href="/poetry/writing">here</a>. If videos are more your speed, I have
  some of those right <a href="/poetry/video">here</a>.
